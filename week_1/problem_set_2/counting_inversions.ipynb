    "Your task is to compute the number of inversions in the file given, where the ith row of the file indicates the ith entry of an array.\n",

    "Because of the large size of this array, you should implement the fast divide-and-conquer algorithm covered in the video lectures.\n",

    "So if your answer is 1198233847, then just type 1198233847 in the space provided without any space / commas / any other punctuation marks. You can make up to 5 attempts, and we'll use the best one for grading.\n",
